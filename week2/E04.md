#  Exercise 1                                                                                          

## Queries to get maximum values from surrogate primary keys. Alter the script to create the primary key column with the correct value to insert new data.


### Finding the maximum Surrogate key

```sql
SELECT TOP(1) category_id
FROM categories
ORDER BY category_id DESC
```
category_id
-----------
         58

```sql
SELECT TOP(1) 
product_id 
FROM products 
ORDER BY product_id DESC
```
product_id 
-----------
       1345

```sql
SELECT TOP(1) order_id 
FROM orders 
ORDER BY order_id DESC
go
```
order_id   
-----------
      68883
```sql
SELECT TOP(1) order_item_id 
FROM order_items 
ORDER BY order_item_id DESC
```
order_item_id
-------------
       172198
```sql
SELECT TOP(1) customer_id 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY customer_id DESC
```
customer_id
-----------
      12435

```sql
SELECT TOP(1) department_id FROM departments ORDER BY department_id DESC
go
```
department_id
-------------
            6

### Creating the sequences

```sql

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.department_sequence
    AS SMALLINT
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    MAXVALUE 6 
    CACHE 5

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.category_sequence
    AS SMALLINT
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    MAXVALUE 58
    CACHE 5

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.product_sequence
    AS SMALLINT
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    MAXVALUE 1345
    CACHE 5

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.customer_sequence
    AS SMALLINT
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    MAXVALUE 12435
    CACHE 5

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.order_sequence
    AS SMALLINT
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    MAXVALUE  68883
    CACHE 5

CREATE SEQUENCE dbo.order_item_sequence
    AS SMALLINT
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    MAXVALUE 172198
    CACHE 5
```

### Adding a few rows into the department table using the sequence

INSERT departments (department_id,department_name)
	VALUES (NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.department_sequence,'Fitness'),
               (NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.department_sequence,'Footwear'),
	       (NEXT VALUE FOR dbo.department_sequence,'Apparel')
GO

# Exercise 2

## Add Foreign Key constraints to the tables
	```sql
	ALTER TABLE dbo.orders
	   ADD CONSTRAINT FK_oci_ci FOREIGN KEY (order_customer_id)
		REFERENCES dbo.customers (customer_id)
		      ON DELETE CASCADE
		      ON UPDATE CASCADE

	ALTER TABLE dbo.order_items
	   ADD CONSTRAINT FK_oioi_oi FOREIGN KEY (order_item_order_id)
		REFERENCES dbo.orders (order_id)
		      ON DELETE CASCADE
		      ON UPDATE CASCADE

        
        ALTER TABLE dbo.order_items
        ADD CONSTRAINT FK_oipi_pi FOREIGN KEY (order_item_product_id)
            REFERENCES dbo.products (product_id)
                ON DELETE CASCADE
                ON UPDATE CASCADE
        
    
        
        ALTER TABLE dbo.products
        ADD CONSTRAINT FK_pci_ci FOREIGN KEY (product_category_id)
            REFERENCES dbo.categories (category_id)
                ON DELETE CASCADE
                ON UPDATE CASCADE
        
    
        
        ALTER TABLE dbo.categories
        ADD CONSTRAINT FK_cdi_di FOREIGN KEY (category_department_id)
            REFERENCES dbo.departments (department_id)
                ON DELETE CASCADE
                ON UPDATE CASCADE
        
	```

# Exercise 3

	```sql

		EXEC sp_helpconstraint customers
		EXEC sp_helpconstraint products
		EXEC sp_helpconstraint orders
		EXEC sp_helpconstraint order_items
		EXEC sp_helpconstraint categories
		EXEC sp_helpconstraint departments


	```
